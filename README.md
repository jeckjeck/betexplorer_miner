A miner for getting even spread and total lines from betexplorer.com. The default bookie is pinnacle,
if pinnacle is not found it uses the most frequent lines.

If you want to save the lines to a db, change dbinfo in dbscript.py.
If not, uncomment the insert_into_db functions. 

pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
